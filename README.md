# HMA
PyTorch implementation for **Homeomorphism Alignment for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation** (ICCV2023). This repository is based on framework from [CAN](https://github.com/kgl-prml/Contrastive-Adaptation-Network-for-Unsupervised-Domain-Adaptation) and modified part of the code. 

The installation can refer to CAN.

Please download datasets to experiments/datasets/ folder.

## Training:
```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=X python tools/train.py --method CAN_INN --cfg experiments/config/home/cfgXXXX.yaml
```
